## Intro

We'll be using `yml/yaml` format for all examples down below, I recommend using `yml` over `toml` as it is easier to read.

---

## Override theme template

By Hugo's Lookup Order, you can override any part of a theme that you want. The following is a quick example.

Let's say you wish the `list` was different. All you have to do is copy the `list` template:

```shell
your-site/themes/papermod/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

And paste it under your own `layouts` folder:

```shell
your-site/layouts/_defaults/list.html
```

Then you're free to make any changes you want to the `list`.
When Hugo builds your site, your copy of `list.html` will be used instead of the theme's `list.html`.

## Enable Social-Metadata and SEO

## Archive Page

```shell
.
├── config.yml
├── content/
│   ├── archives.md   <--- Create archive.md here
│   └── posts/
├── static/
└── themes/
    └── hugo-PaperMod/
```

and add the following to it

```yml
---

```

## Custom Head / Footer

Custom css/js can be added by way mentioned below.

```
.(site root)
├── config.yml
├── content/
├── theme/hugo-PaperMod/
└── layouts
    ├── partials
    │   ├── comments.html
    │   ├── extend_footer.html <---
    │   └── extend_head.html   <---
    └── robots.txt
```

Create a html page in directory structure as shown above.

Contents of `extend_head.html` will be added to `head` of page.

and contents of `extend_footer.html` will be added to bottom of page.

## Pin a Post

Post can be pinned/ displayed top on the list by adding a `weight=<num>` var to page-variables

example:

```yml
---
title: "My Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
weight: 1
---

```

```yml
---
title: "My 2nd Important post"
date: 2020-09-15T11:30:03+00:00
